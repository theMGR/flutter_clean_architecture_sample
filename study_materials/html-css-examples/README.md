## Contributing

Contributing is welcome! Follow these steps to add your examples:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch, starting with `feature/`. 
3. Structure your project according to the existing ones (note the latest numbering).
4. Run `yarn run watch` or `npm run watch`. This will monitor changes in `src/index.js` and compile it to `/index.js`, which is used to display React components for the demo page.
5. Update `src/index.js`. Add your example name and link at the top of the `uis` array, set `newItem` to `true`, and remove the `newItem` property from the previous item.
6. Test and issue a PR.
7. Please ensure examples are aethetically pleasing.

Notice: By contributing, you agree that your code may be used for demonstration in some of my videos.
