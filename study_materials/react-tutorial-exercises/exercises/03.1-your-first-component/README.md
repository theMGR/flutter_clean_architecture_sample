# `03.1` Your first functional component

When you create functions that return HTML, JSX will let you treat them as **Components**. Basically they will become your own custom HTML tags.

> Creating our first functional Component

> One of the things we can do thanks to JSX is calling functions like they are an HTML tag, for example:

```js
// If we declare a function called MyFunction
const MyFunction = () => {
    return <h1>I Love React</h1>;
}

// We can call the function as an HTML tag like this:
<MyFunction />

// Instead of the typical way of using round brackets
MyFunction();
```

When you call a function like that, it becomes a **React component**, which is a function that generates (returns) HTML dynamically. Whatever the function returns will be replaced in the same place as the original `<MyFunction />` was placed.

## üìù Instructions:

1. On the 9th line of `app.jsx`, change the way the function is called, call the function as a **React component** using `<` and `>` like it an HTML tag (instead of parentheses).
