# `03.2` A real component

In the past exercise we created our first component called `PrintHello`, and we have learned that we can use the component like an HTML tag.

```jsx
<PrintHello />
```

Now let's create another component (function) called `<BootstrapCard />` that outputs the following HTML:

```jsx
<div class="card m-5">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="../../.learn/assets/Dylan.png?raw=true" alt="Card image cap" />
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Bob Dylan</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer/songwriter, author, and artist who has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades.</p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan" class="btn btn-primary">Go to wikipedia</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

> ‚òù Note: This HTML code is based on the [Bootstrap Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/).

## üìù Instructions:

1. Please create a function called `BootstrapCard` that returns the card code and use the `ReactDOM.render` function and `<BootstrapCard />` to add it into the website inside `#myDiv`.

## üí° Hints:

+ If you don't know or remember how to use `ReactDOM.render` you can review the past exercises.

+ Remember to use the correct React syntax `className` instead of `class` when creating your bootstrap card.
