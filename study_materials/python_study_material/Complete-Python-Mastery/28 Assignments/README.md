### Assignment 19: Polymorphism

1. **Function Overloading:**
   - Create a class called `MathOperations` with methods for addition and multiplication.
   - Implement function overloading by creating methods with the same name but different parameter types.
   - Demonstrate the use of both methods by creating an object of the class and calling each method.

2. **Operator Overloading:**
   - Create a class called `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers.
   - Implement the `__add__` method to overload the addition operator for complex numbers.
   - Create two objects of the class and demonstrate the use of the `+` operator for complex number addition.

### Assignment 20: Exception Handling

1. **Division by Zero Handling:**
   - Write a function that takes two numbers as input and performs division.
   - Implement exception handling to catch a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second number is zero.
   - Print an appropriate error message in case of an exception.

2. **File Handling with Try-Except:**
   - Modify the file reading assignment from earlier to include exception handling.
   - Use a try-except block to catch and print any `FileNotFoundError` that may occur.

### Assignment 21: Modules

1. **Module Creation:**
   - Create a Python module named `calculator` that contains functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Import and use this module in a separate script to perform calculations.

2. **Custom Exception Module:**
   - Create a module named `custom_exceptions` that defines a custom exception class `InvalidInputError`.
   - Use this module in a script to raise and catch instances of the custom exception.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages.
- Emphasize the importance of proper module organization and usage.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of polymorphism, exception handling, and modules in their solutions.
