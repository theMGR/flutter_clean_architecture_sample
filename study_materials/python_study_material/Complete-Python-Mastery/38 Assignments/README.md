### Assignment 24: NumPy

1. **Array Operations:**
   - Create two NumPy arrays of the same shape.
   - Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Print the results.

2. **Array Manipulation:**
   - Create a NumPy array and reshape it into a different shape.
   - Extract specific elements or slices from the array.
   - Print the manipulated array.

3. **Statistical Operations:**
   - Generate a random NumPy array of numbers.
   - Calculate and print the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.

### Assignment 25: Pandas

1. **DataFrame Creation:**
   - Create a Pandas DataFrame from a dictionary with multiple columns.
   - Print the DataFrame.

2. **Data Selection and Filtering:**
   - Use a sample dataset or create one.
   - Select specific columns from the DataFrame.
   - Apply filtering conditions to retrieve specific rows.

3. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Aggregate data by grouping the DataFrame based on a specific column.
   - Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, sum) for each group.
   - Print the aggregated results.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to handle missing or invalid data appropriately.
- Emphasize the importance of understanding basic operations and manipulations in both NumPy and Pandas.
- Encourage experimentation with different datasets or scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of NumPy and Pandas in their solutions.
