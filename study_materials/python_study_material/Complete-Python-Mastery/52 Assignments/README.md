### Assignment 22: Multithreading

1. **Basic Multithreading:**
   - Write a Python program that utilizes multithreading to perform two different tasks concurrently.
   - Use the `threading` module to create two threads, each performing a specific task.
   - Demonstrate the execution of both threads.

2. **Thread Synchronization:**
   - Extend the previous program to showcase thread synchronization.
   - Implement a shared resource (e.g., a counter) and use locks to prevent race conditions.
   - Ensure that the shared resource is updated safely by multiple threads.

### Assignment 23: MySQL with Python

1. **Database Connection:**
   - Install the `mysql-connector-python` package.
   - Write a Python script to connect to a MySQL database using the `mysql.connector` module.
   - Print a confirmation message upon successful connection.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Create a table in the MySQL database with sample data (e.g., a simple user table).
   - Write a Python script to query and retrieve data from the table.
   - Print the results.

3. **Data Insertion and Update:**
   - Extend the script to insert new records into the table and update existing records.
   - Print the updated results after the operations.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to handle multithreading synchronization carefully to avoid race conditions.
- Emphasize the importance of securely managing database connections and handling exceptions.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of multithreading and MySQL in their solutions.
