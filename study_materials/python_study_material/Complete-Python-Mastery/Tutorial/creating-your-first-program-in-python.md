# Creating Your First Program in Python

Welcome to **codeswithpankaj.com**! If you're just starting with Python, this guide will help you set up Python, write your first program, and run it in multiple environments. Let's get started!

***

### **Step 1: Installation of Python**

1. **Download Python**
   * Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   * Click on the **Download Python** button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Install Python**
   * Run the downloaded installer.
   * Ensure you check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking "Install Now."
   * Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. **Verify Installation**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   *   Type the following command and press Enter:

       ```bash
       python --version
       ```
   * You should see the Python version displayed (e.g., `Python 3.x.x`).

### **Step 2: Creating and Running a Python Program**

1.  **Write Your First Program**\
    Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad on Windows) and type the following code:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
2. **Save the File**\
   Save the file with the `.py` extension, for example, `hello.py`.
3. **Run the Program**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to the folder where you saved `hello.py` using the `cd` command.
   *   Type the following command and press Enter:

       ```bash
       python hello.py
       ```
   *   Output:

       ```
       Hello, World!
       ```

### **Step 3: Writing a Python Program using the Command-line Window**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `python` and press Enter to enter the interactive mode.
3.  In the Python shell, type:

    ```python
    print("Welcome to CodesWithPankaj!")
    ```
4.  Press Enter, and you'll see:

    ```
    Welcome to CodesWithPankaj!
    ```

This is a quick way to test Python code without creating a file.

***

### **Step 4: Using Python IDLE**

1. **Open Python IDLE**
   * After installation, search for **IDLE** in your system and open it.
2. **Write Your Code**
   *   In the IDLE shell, type:

       ```python
       print("Learning Python is fun!")
       ```
   *   Press Enter, and you'll see:

       ```
       Learning Python is fun!
       ```
3. **Create a Script in IDLE**
   * Click on **File > New File** to open the editor window.
   *   Type the following code:

       ```python
       print("This is my first Python script in IDLE!")
       ```
   * Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `script.py`).
4. **Run the Script**
   * Press `F5` or go to **Run > Run Module**.
   *   Output in the IDLE shell:

       ```
       This is my first Python script in IDLE!
       ```

### **Step 5: Interactive Python**

Python's interactive mode allows you to test snippets of code quickly.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `python` to enter interactive mode.
3.  You can directly type Python commands and see immediate results. Example:

    ```python
    name = "Pankaj"
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    Hello, Pankaj!
    ```
