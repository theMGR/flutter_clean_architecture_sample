### 1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods. OOP aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc., in programming.

#### Why OOP is Important

OOP helps in:

* Organizing code into reusable and logical structures
* Encapsulating data and functionality together
* Facilitating code maintenance and scalability
* Enhancing code readability and manageability

### 2. Defining a Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class can use.

#### Syntax

```python
class ClassName:
    # class attributes and methods
```

#### Example

```python
# Defining a class
class Person:
    pass  # Placeholder for an empty class

# Creating an object
p = Person()
print(p)  # Output: <__main__.Person object at 0x7f4a4d2e3b20>
```

In this example, we define an empty class named `Person` using the `class` keyword. The `pass` statement is a placeholder indicating that the class has no content yet. We then create an object `p` from the `Person` class.

***

### 3. Creating Objects

Objects are instances of a class. You can create multiple objects from a single class.

#### Example

```python
# Defining a class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Creating objects
person1 = Person("John", 25)
person2 = Person("Jane", 30)

print(person1.name, person1.age)  # Output: John 25
print(person2.name, person2.age)  # Output: Jane 30
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class with an `__init__` method that initializes the `name` and `age` attributes. We then create two objects, `person1` and `person2`, from the `Person` class, passing different values for the `name` and `age` attributes.

***

### 4. Class Attributes and Methods

Class attributes are variables that belong to the class. Methods are functions defined inside the class that describe the behaviors of the objects.

#### Example

```python
class Person:
    species = "Homo sapiens"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating an object
person1 = Person("John", 25)
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
print(person1.species)  # Output: Homo sapiens
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class with a class attribute `species` and an instance method `greet`. The `greet` method prints a greeting message using the object's `name` and `age` attributes. We create an object `person1` from the `Person` class and call the `greet` method.

***

### 5. The `__init__` Method

The `__init__` method is a special method called a constructor. It is automatically called when an object is created and is used to initialize the object's attributes.

#### Example

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating an object
person1 = Person("John", 25)
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example, the `__init__` method initializes the `name` and `age` attributes for each object created from the `Person` class. When we create an object `person1`, the `__init__` method is called automatically with the values `"John"` and `25` as arguments.

***

### 6. Instance Attributes

Instance attributes are variables that are specific to an object. They are defined within the `__init__` method and prefixed with `self`.

#### Example

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating objects
person1 = Person("John", 25)
person2 = Person("Jane", 30)

print(person1.name, person1.age)  # Output: John 25
print(person2.name, person2.age)  # Output: Jane 30
```

In this example, we define instance attributes `name` and `age` within the `__init__` method. These attributes are specific to each object created from the `Person` class.

***

### 7. Instance Methods

Instance methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on instances of the class. They are defined with `self` as their first parameter.

#### Example

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating an object
person1 = Person("John", 25)
person1.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

In this example, the `greet` method is an instance method that prints a greeting message using the object's `name` and `age` attributes. We create an object `person1` from the `Person` class and call the `greet` method.

***

### 8. Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Bank Account Class

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance=0):
        self.account_number = account_number
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")

# Creating an object
account = BankAccount("12345678", 1000)
account.deposit(500)  # Output: Deposited $500. New balance: $1500
account.withdraw(200)  # Output: Withdrew $200. New balance: $1300
account.withdraw(2000)  # Output: Insufficient funds
```

In this example, we define a `BankAccount` class with attributes `account_number` and `balance`. The class has methods for depositing and withdrawing money. We create an object `account` from the `BankAccount` class and perform deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### Example 2: Car Class

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        self.odometer = 0

    def drive(self, miles):
        self.odometer += miles
        print(f"Drove {miles} miles. Total miles: {self.odometer}")

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}, Odometer: {self.odometer} miles")

# Creating an object
car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car.drive(100)  # Output: Drove 100 miles. Total miles: 100
car.display_info()  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla, Odometer: 100 miles
```

In this example, we define a `Car` class with attributes `make`, `model`, `year`, and `odometer`. The class has methods for driving the car and displaying its information. We create an object `car` from the `Car` class and perform driving and display operations.
