### 1. Introduction to Warm Up Project Exercises

Welcome to the warm-up project exercises section. In this section, we will focus on building your foundational Python skills through a series of exercises. These exercises are designed to be simple yet effective in helping you understand core Python concepts.

#### Topics Covered

* Displaying information
* Accepting user input
* Validating user input
* Simple user interaction

***

### 2. Displaying Information

In this section, we will learn how to display information to the user using the `print()` function.

#### Syntax

```python
print("Your message here")
```

#### Example

```python
# Displaying a simple message
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!

# Displaying multiple pieces of information
name = "Pankaj"
age = 30
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}")  # Output: Name: Pankaj, Age: 30
```

***

### 3. Accepting User Input

Next, we will learn how to accept user input using the `input()` function. This allows us to interact with the user by asking for their input.

#### Syntax

```python
variable = input("Your prompt here: ")
```

#### Example

```python
# Accepting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Output will vary based on user input

# Accepting numerical input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"You are {age} years old.")  # Output will vary based on user input
```

***

### 4. Validating User Input

Validating user input is crucial to ensure the correctness of the data entered by the user. We will learn how to check if the input meets certain criteria and handle invalid input gracefully.

#### Example

```python
# Validating user input
age = input("Enter your age: ")
if age.isdigit():
    age = int(age)
    print(f"You are {age} years old.")
else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid age.")  # Handling invalid input
```

#### Accepting Only Specific Choices

```python
# Validating user choice
choice = input("Enter your choice (yes/no): ").lower()
if choice in ["yes", "no"]:
    print(f"You chose {choice}.")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.")  # Handling invalid input
```

***

### 5. Simple User Interaction

We will now learn how to create simple interactive programs that combine displaying information, accepting user input, and validating user input.

#### Example

```python
# Simple user interaction program
print("Welcome to the simple calculator!")
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        result = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

print(f"The result is: {result}")
```

***

### 6. First Python Milestone Project Overview

In this section, we will discuss the first Python milestone project. This project is designed to consolidate the skills you have learned so far and apply them in a more comprehensive program.

#### Project Description

The first milestone project involves creating a basic text-based game or application. This could be anything from a simple calculator to a number guessing game. The goal is to use your knowledge of displaying information, accepting user input, validating user input, and creating interactive programs.

#### Project Requirements

* The project should display information to the user.
* The project should accept and validate user input.
* The project should provide feedback based on the user's input.
* The project should include a loop to allow the user to interact with the program multiple times.

### 7. Milestone Project Help

In this section, we will provide tips and guidance to help you complete the first milestone project successfully.

#### Tips for Success

1. **Plan Your Project**: Before you start coding, outline the steps and logic of your project. This will help you stay organized and focused.
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic version of your project and gradually add features.
3. **Test Frequently**: Regularly test your code to catch and fix errors early.
4. **Ask for Help**: If you get stuck, don't hesitate to seek help from online resources, forums, or fellow learners.

### 8. Solution Overview for Milestone Project 1 - Part One

In this section, we will provide a detailed walkthrough of the solution for the first milestone project. We will break down the project into manageable parts and explain each step.

#### Part One: Project Setup and Basic Functionality

1. **Display a Welcome Message**: Start by displaying a welcome message to the user.
2. **Accept User Input**: Prompt the user to enter information (e.g., numbers for a calculator).
3. **Perform Calculations**: Implement the logic to perform calculations based on user input.
4. **Display Results**: Show the results of the calculations to the user.

#### Example Code

```python
# Part One: Project Setup and Basic Functionality

print("Welcome to the simple calculator!")

while True:
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ")

    if operation == "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == "/":
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            result = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"
    else:
        result = "Invalid operation"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")

    # Prompt the user to perform another calculation or exit
    choice = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if choice != "yes":
        break

print("Thank you for using the simple calculator!")
```

### 9. Solution Overview for Milestone Project 1 - Part Two

In this section, we will extend the functionality of our project by adding more features and improving user experience.

#### Part Two: Enhancing Functionality and User Experience

1. **Add Input Validation**: Ensure that the user enters valid numbers and operations.
2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide meaningful error messages for invalid input.
3. **Implement Additional Features**: Add more operations or features (e.g., exponentiation, square root).

#### Example Code

```python
# Part Two: Enhancing Functionality and User Experience

def get_number(prompt):
    while True:
        try:
            return float(input(prompt))
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

def get_operation():
    while True:
        operation = input("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /, **, sqrt): ").lower()
        if operation in ["+", "-", "*", "/", "**", "sqrt"]:
            return operation
        else:
            print("Invalid operation. Please enter a valid operation.")

print("Welcome to the advanced calculator!")

while True:
    num1 = get_number("Enter the first number: ")
    
    operation = get_operation()
    
    if operation != "sqrt":
        num2 = get_number("Enter the second number: ")

    if operation == "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == "/":
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            result = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"
    elif operation == "**":
        result = num1 ** num2
    elif operation == "sqrt":
        if num1 >= 0:
            result = num1 ** 0.5
        else:
            result = "Undefined (cannot calculate the square root of a negative number)"

    print(f"The result is: {result}")

    # Prompt the user to perform another calculation or exit
    choice = input("Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if choice != "yes":
        break

print("Thank you for using the advanced calculator!")
```
