### Getting the IP Address of a Website in Python

To check the IP address of a website in Python, you can use the `socket` library. The following code demonstrates how to obtain the IP address of a specified website and provides explanations for each step:

```python
import socket

def get_ip_address(domain):
    try:
        # Use socket.gethostbyname() to retrieve the IP address of the domain
        ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(domain)
        return ip_address
    except socket.error as e:
        # Handle any potential errors, such as an invalid domain
        return f"Error: {e}"

# Example usage:
website_domain = "www.codeswithpankaj.com"

# Call the get_ip_address function to get the IP address of the specified website
ip_address = get_ip_address(website_domain)

# Print the result
print(f"The IP address of {website_domain} is: {ip_address}")
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Importing the `socket` Module:**
   ```python
   import socket
   ```
   Import the `socket` module, which provides access to the low-level networking interface of the operating system.

2. **Defining the `get_ip_address` Function:**
   ```python
   def get_ip_address(domain):
   ```
   Define a function named `get_ip_address` that takes a domain name as its parameter.

3. **Using `socket.gethostbyname()`:**
   ```python
   try:
       ip_address = socket.gethostbyname(domain)
       return ip_address
   ```
   Inside the function, use the `socket.gethostbyname()` method to retrieve the IP address associated with the specified domain. This method translates a host name to its corresponding IP address.

4. **Handling Errors:**
   ```python
   except socket.error as e:
       return f"Error: {e}"
   ```
   Use a try-except block to catch any potential errors that may occur during the execution, such as an invalid domain. If an error occurs, return an error message.

5. **Example Usage:**
   ```python
   website_domain = "www.codeswithpankaj.com"
   ip_address = get_ip_address(website_domain)
   ```
   Replace the `website_domain` variable with the desired website's domain. Call the `get_ip_address` function to obtain the corresponding IP address.

6. **Print the Result:**
   ```python
   print(f"The IP address of {website_domain} is: {ip_address}")
   ```
   Print the obtained IP address of the specified website.

When you run this script, it will output the IP address of the specified website.
