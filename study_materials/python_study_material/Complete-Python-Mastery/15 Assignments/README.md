1. **Set Operations:**
   - Create two sets of your favorite fruits.
   - Write a function named `print_unique_fruits` that takes two sets as parameters and prints the unique fruits present in both sets.
   - Call the function with your sets.

2. **Set Intersection:**
   - Create two sets of numbers.
   - Write a function named `common_numbers` that takes two sets as parameters and returns a new set containing the common numbers.
   - Call the function with your sets and print the results.

3. **Set Difference:**
   - Create two sets of animals.
   - Write a function named `unique_animals` that takes two sets as parameters and returns a new set containing the animals unique to each set.
   - Call the function with your sets and print the results.

### Assignment 11: Dictionaries

1. **Dictionary Operations:**
   - Create a dictionary of your favorite movies with movie names as keys and release years as values.
   - Write a function named `print_movies` that takes a dictionary as a parameter and prints each movie along with its release year.
   - Call the function with your dictionary.

2. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - Create a dictionary of cities and their populations.
   - Write a function named `calculate_total_population` that takes a dictionary as a parameter and returns the total population.
   - Call the function with your dictionary and print the result.

3. **Dictionary Update:**
   - Create a dictionary representing a person's information (name, age, city).
   - Write a function named `update_city` that takes a dictionary as a parameter and updates the city information.
   - Call the function with your dictionary and print the updated dictionary.

### Assignment 12: Strings

1. **String Concatenation:**

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to call the functions with different values to test their implementations.
- Emphasize the importance of code readability and efficiency.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of sets, dictionaries, and strings in their solutions.
