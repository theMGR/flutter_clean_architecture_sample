### Assignment 13: File Handling

1. **File Reading:**
   - Create a text file named `sample.txt` with some content.
   - Write a function named `read_file` that takes the file name as a parameter and reads and prints the content of the file.
   - Call the function with the file name.

2. **File Writing:**
   - Write a function named `write_to_file` that takes a string and a file name as parameters and writes the string to a new file.
   - Call the function with a sample string and a new file name.

3. **File Copy:**
   - Write a function named `copy_file` that takes two file names as parameters and copies the content of one file to another.
   - Call the function with two existing file names.

### Assignment 14: `break` and `continue`

1. **Number Search:**
   - Write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
   - Use `break` to stop the loop when the number 5 is reached.
   - Print the numbers up to that point.

2. **Even Number Skip:**
   - Write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
   - Use `continue` to skip printing even numbers.
   - Print only the odd numbers.

3. **User Input Loop:**
   - Write a program that takes a user's input in a loop.
   - Use `break` to exit the loop when the user enters the word "exit" and print the entered values.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to handle file exceptions and close files properly.
- Emphasize the importance of proper indentation in Python.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of file handling, `break`, and `continue` in their solutions.
