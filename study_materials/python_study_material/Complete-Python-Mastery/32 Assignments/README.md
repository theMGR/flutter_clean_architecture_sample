### Assignment 15: Classes and Objects

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Define a class named `Car` with attributes such as `make`, `model`, and `year`.
   - Write a method within the class to display information about the car.

2. **Object Creation:**
   - Create an object of the `Car` class.
   - Set values for the attributes and call the method to display the car information.

3. **Constructor Implementation:**
   - Modify the `Car` class to include a constructor that initializes the attributes.
   - Create multiple objects using the constructor.

### Assignment 16: Inheritance

1. **Inheritance Setup:**
   - Create a parent class named `Vehicle` with attributes common to various vehicles.
   - Create a child class named `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds specific attributes for cars.

2. **Method Overriding:**
   - Define a method in the `Vehicle` class and override it in the `Car` class.
   - Demonstrate method overriding by creating objects of both classes and calling the methods.

### Assignment 17: Abstract Classes

1. **Abstract Class Setup:**
   - Create an abstract class named `Shape` with an abstract method `calculate_area`.
   - Create two subclasses (`Circle` and `Rectangle`) that inherit from `Shape` and implement the `calculate_area` method.

2. **Shape Calculation:**
   - Create objects of both `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes.
   - Call the `calculate_area` method for each object and print the results.

### Assignment 18: Encapsulation

1. **Encapsulation Implementation:**
   - Create a class named `Employee` with private attributes such as `name`, `salary`, and `designation`.
   - Write getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Implement data validation in the setter methods to ensure that the salary is positive and the designation is a valid job title.
   - Demonstrate these validations by creating objects and attempting to set invalid values.

### Instructions:

- Encourage students to use meaningful variable names and provide comments explaining their code.
- Remind students to handle class initialization and method calls appropriately.
- Emphasize the importance of proper indentation in Python.
- Encourage experimentation with different scenarios to ensure the correctness of the code.
- Provide feedback on the usage of classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, abstract classes, and encapsulation in their solutions.
